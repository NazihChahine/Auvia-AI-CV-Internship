This course offers a practical and comprehensive introduction to OpenCV, covering essential image processing concepts and techniques used in computer vision. Through hands-on coding examples, you’ll learn how to manipulate and analyze images efficiently using Python and OpenCV.

Topics Covered:
Basic Image Operations

Reading, displaying, and saving images

Color conversions (BGR to Grayscale, HSV, etc.)

Image blurring and smoothing techniques

Edge detection using Canny

Image transformations: resizing, cropping, rotating, flipping

Morphological Operations

Dilating and eroding images to process object shapes

Opening and closing operations to clean up image noise

Advanced Processing

Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)

Image masking techniques

Histogram analysis (grayscale and color histograms)

Image thresholding (binary, adaptive, Otsu’s method)

Object Detection and Recognition

Face detection using Haar cascades

Face recognition techniques with OpenCV

Image Transformations

Geometric transformations (translation, rotation, affine transforms)

Perspective warping and transformations

Image smoothing using filters (Gaussian, median, bilateral)
